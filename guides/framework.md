# Framework

The core functionality of Microweber consists of the Framework, core modules and templates.
When developing custom features you should reuse as much of the built-in code as possible, as it's designed to ease most tasks.
All framework source code resides in `src/Microweber`.

* [Models](framework_models.md) can be used for direct access to database tables.
* [Managers](framework_managers.md) provide richer and more advanced functionality.
* [Events](framework_events.md) can be used to perform custom actions in key places aiding with extending system user interface and responding to key occurences.
