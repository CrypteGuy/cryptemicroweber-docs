# Configuration


Your Microweber application uses the Laravel config class in order to load the system variables, such as database credentials and internal settings.

## Enable debugging

If you get some errors and would like to debug them, you can enable the debug output from the file `config/app.php`

You must set `'debug' => true` on [this line](https://github.com/microweber/microweber/blob/master/config/app.php#L16 "")


## Database configuration

The database credentials are located in `config/database.php`

The sample database config file can be viewed here: [https://github.com/microweber/microweber/blob/master/config/database.php](https://github.com/microweber/microweber/blob/master/config/database.php "")
