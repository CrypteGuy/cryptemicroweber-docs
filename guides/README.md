# Microweber Developer Guide
Microweber is a multi-featured extendable open source content management system based on the robust [Laravel Framework](http://laravel.com/). It enables any web site to become a rich environment for you to express your thoughts and sell products in Internet. 

While there are many good technologies that exist and can be used together, you will hardly find a single software that combines them in the right way. 

Microweber is build on these existing technologies and gives the developers and the  users a single tool that makes the website creation process easier than before.


It empowers regular users and programmers to make websites with ease. 


 
### What Microweber is made of?

#### Live edit

With the "Live Edit" mode you can edit the content of the site directly on its front-end. You don't have to switch between the admin panel and the site in order to see how your content looks. 



#### Modules

The modules act as independent containers of information. They can be reused across pages. Modules can include other modules as "building blocks" and can contain any functionality.

You can reload every module of the fly and there is no need to reload the whole page in order to see your updated content.
