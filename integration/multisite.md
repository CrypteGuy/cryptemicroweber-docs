# Multisite

Microweber allows for hosting more than one website on a single installation.
This is a core feature and a result of leveraging the Laravel framework and contemporary software design patterns and approaches.

Each site can have its own configuration, meaning you can virtually separate most of the computing resources for each user.

### Switch on multisite

To enable this aspect of Microweber you only have to [setup multisite](../guides/installation.md#multi-site-setup).
Then each domain that resolves to your Microweber installation will be handled separately.

The configuration subsystem is entirely domain-based so you can switch to multisite at any time after obtaining a copy of the Microweber code.

You might further want to see ways of [scripted installation] as a part of your deployment process.
