### Modules

* Thhe modules act as independant containers of iromation. They can be reused acrooss pages and have sub modules.
* Modules can include other modules as "building blocks" so you dont have to write that complex dropdown menu wtice, on any site.
* Modules are as flexible as php is, with them you can modify the whole application. You can replace functions, add routing, hooks, contollers, models, etc.
* Modules can contain editable regions, you can make a fancy banner module which can have editable text from the "live edit"


### PHP API

Microwebr have procedural and OOP api so you can easily get and save data anywhere. 

We decided to have functions in our system, because they are esier to write by a front-end developer. Of cource the core functions are just e refferente to a more complex OOP code. If you preffer to use functions or classes, they are generally the same. The only diffrence is that all functions reffer to the latest `application` insstance. Also the classes contain more advanced functionality. 

### JS/CSS 

We have several handy thngs you can use to style your website or make your modules more dynamic.
