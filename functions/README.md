#### Microweber functions API

There are many useful functions you can use while developing templates and modules. They are separated in sections related to their purpose. 

We decided to have functions in our system, because they are esier to write by a front-end developer. Of course the core functions are just e reference to a more complex OOP code. If you prefer to use functions or classes, they are generally the same. Just the classes contain more advanced functionality.


As just a few functions are listed for now, there are much more that are not documented yet.
