#### Microweber functions API

There are many useful functions you can use while developing templates and modules. They are separated in sections related to their purpose. 

We decided to have functions in our system, because they are easier to write by a front-end developer. 

Of course the core functions are just e reference to a more complex OOP code. If you prefer to use functions or classes, they are generally the same. Just the classes hold more advanced functionality.


As just a few functions are listed for now, there are more that are not documented yet.
