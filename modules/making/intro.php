<h2>Intorduction to Modules</h2>
<p> The modules in Microweber are the building blocks of your website. </p><p>They are used to extend your site's functionality beyond simple text writing.<br>
  With them you can show dynamic information from the database and write custom logic and functions.</p>
<p> The modules can work independently of the content and the "design" of your site and can even have their own "skins" </p>
<p> In the most cases the modules are the "blocks" that you drag and drop around your website.</p>
<h3>Module folder structure</h3>
<p>Each module have its own folder located at userfiles/modules/<module name></p>
